// Need to add 2d text into your 3d scene? Here's how and why.


  // Render the text via the canvas.
  var canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
  
  // The important step to remember next is to immediatley
  // define your canvas width and height.
  canvas.width = 60;
  canvas.height = 20;
  
  // Finish your first code snippet with a context call.
  var context = canvas.getContext('2d');
  context.fillText("Branden Dane FTW", 0, 10);

  // Now the last bit of magic comes from updating threejs with
  // the canvas information. Set to true.
  var texture = new THREE.Texture(canvas);
  texture.needsUpdate = true;
  
  // Sprite is used here. Other methods will work as well.
  var sprite = new THREE.Sprite({
    map: texture,
    transparent: true,
    useScreenCoordinates: false
  });
  sprite.position.set(0,-150,0);
  scene.add(sprite);
